//there does not seem any explicit errors
//I ran console.log post each operation, unsure where it went wrong.
    //removed for the sake of clarity
//I have cleaned up the code multiple times, console.log seems to be accurate.
//The error is not technical but most likely in my methodology that is if there is an error.
//unsure if related to ("16‚Äù sections, is 5.375, rounded up to 6") alteration
